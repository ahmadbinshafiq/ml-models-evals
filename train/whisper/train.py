"""## Load Dataset

Using ðŸ¤— Datasets, downloading and preparing data is extremely simple.
We can download and prepare the Common Voice splits in just one line of code.

First, ensure you have accepted the terms of use on the Hugging Face Hub: [mozilla-foundation/common_voice_11_0](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mozilla-foundation/common_voice_11_0). Once you have accepted the terms, you will have full access to the dataset and be able to download the data locally.

Since Hindi is very low-resource, we'll combine the `train` and `validation`
splits to give approximately 8 hours of training data. We'll use the 4 hours
of `test` data as our held-out test set:

"""## Prepare Feature Extractor, Tokenizer and Data

The ASR pipeline can be de-composed into three stages:
1) A feature extractor which pre-processes the raw audio-inputs
2) The model which performs the sequence-to-sequence mapping
3) A tokenizer which post-processes the model outputs to text format

In ðŸ¤— Transformers, the Whisper model has an associated feature extractor and tokenizer,
called [WhisperFeatureExtractor](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/whisper#transformers.WhisperFeatureExtractor)
and [WhisperTokenizer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/whisper#transformers.WhisperTokenizer)
respectively.

We'll go through details for setting-up the feature extractor and tokenizer one-by-one!

### Load WhisperFeatureExtractor

The Whisper feature extractor performs two operations:
1. Pads / truncates the audio inputs to 30s: any audio inputs shorter than 30s are padded to 30s with silence (zeros), and those longer that 30s are truncated to 30s
2. Converts the audio inputs to _log-Mel spectrogram_ input features, a visual representation of the audio and the form of the input expected by the Whisper model

</figcaption>

We'll load the feature extractor from the pre-trained checkpoint with the default values:
"""

from transformers import WhisperFeatureExtractor

feature_extractor = WhisperFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME, token=access_token)

"""### Load WhisperTokenizer

The Whisper model outputs a sequence of _token ids_. The tokenizer maps each of these token ids to their corresponding text string. For Hindi, we can load the pre-trained tokenizer and use it for fine-tuning without any further modifications. We simply have to
specify the target language and the task. These arguments inform the
tokenizer to prefix the language and task tokens to the start of encoded
label sequences:
"""

from transformers import WhisperTokenizer

tokenizer = WhisperTokenizer.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME, language="Hindi", task="transcribe", token=access_token)

"""### Combine To Create A WhisperProcessor

To simplify using the feature extractor and tokenizer, we can _wrap_
both into a single `WhisperProcessor` class. This processor object
inherits from the `WhisperFeatureExtractor` and `WhisperProcessor`,
and can be used on the audio inputs and model predictions as required.
In doing so, we only need to keep track of two objects during training:
the `processor` and the `model`:
"""

from transformers import WhisperProcessor

processor = WhisperProcessor.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME, language="Hindi", task="transcribe", token=access_token)

"""### Prepare Data

Let's print the first example of the Common Voice dataset to see
what form the data is in:
"""

print(common_voice["train"][0])

"""Since
our input audio is sampled at 48kHz, we need to _downsample_ it to
16kHz prior to passing it to the Whisper feature extractor, 16kHz being the sampling rate expected by the Whisper model.

We'll set the audio inputs to the correct sampling rate using dataset's
[`cast_column`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/package_reference/main_classes.html?highlight=cast_column#datasets.DatasetDict.cast_column)
method. This operation does not change the audio in-place,
but rather signals to `datasets` to resample audio samples _on the fly_ the
first time that they are loaded:
"""

from datasets import Audio

common_voice = common_voice.cast_column("audio", Audio(sampling_rate=16000))

"""Re-loading the first audio sample in the Common Voice dataset will resample
it to the desired sampling rate:
"""

print(common_voice["train"][0])

"""Now we can write a function to prepare our data ready for the model:
1. We load and resample the audio data by calling `batch["audio"]`. As explained above, ðŸ¤— Datasets performs any necessary resampling operations on the fly.
2. We use the feature extractor to compute the log-Mel spectrogram input features from our 1-dimensional audio array.
3. We encode the transcriptions to label ids through the use of the tokenizer.
"""

    # load and resample audio data from 48 to 16kHz
    audio = batch["audio"]

    # compute log-Mel input features from input audio array
    batch["input_features"] = feature_extractor(audio["array"], sampling_rate=audio["sampling_rate"]).input_features[0]

    # encode target text to label ids
    batch["labels"] = tokenizer(batch["sentence"]).input_ids
    return batch

"""We can apply the data preparation function to all of our training examples using dataset's `.map` method. The argument `num_proc` specifies how many CPU cores to use. Setting `num_proc` > 1 will enable multiprocessing. If the `.map` method hangs with multiprocessing, set `num_proc=1` and process the dataset sequentially."""

common_voice = common_voice.map(prepare_dataset, remove_columns=common_voice.column_names["train"], num_proc=2)

"""## Training and Evaluation

Now that we've prepared our data, we're ready to dive into the training pipeline.
The [ðŸ¤— Trainer](https://huggingface.co/transformers/master/main_classes/trainer.html?highlight=trainer)
will do much of the heavy lifting for us. All we have to do is:

- Define a data collator: the data collator takes our pre-processed data and prepares PyTorch tensors ready for the model.

- Evaluation metrics: during evaluation, we want to evaluate the model using the [word error rate (WER)](https://huggingface.co/metrics/wer) metric. We need to define a `compute_metrics` function that handles this computation.

- Load a pre-trained checkpoint: we need to load a pre-trained checkpoint and configure it correctly for training.

- Define the training configuration: this will be used by the ðŸ¤— Trainer to define the training schedule.

Once we've fine-tuned the model, we will evaluate it on the test data to verify that we have correctly trained it
to transcribe speech in Hindi.

### Define a Data Collator

The data collator for a sequence-to-sequence speech model is unique in the sense that it
treats the `input_features` and `labels` independently: the  `input_features` must be
handled by the feature extractor and the `labels` by the tokenizer.

The `input_features` are already padded to 30s and converted to a log-Mel spectrogram
of fixed dimension by action of the feature extractor, so all we have to do is convert the `input_features`
to batched PyTorch tensors. We do this using the feature extractor's `.pad` method with `return_tensors=pt`.

The `labels` on the other hand are un-padded. We first pad the sequences
to the maximum length in the batch using the tokenizer's `.pad` method. The padding tokens
are then replaced by `-100` so that these tokens are **not** taken into account when
computing the loss. We then cut the BOS token from the start of the label sequence as we
append it later during training.

We can leverage the `WhisperProcessor` we defined earlier to perform both the
feature extractor and the tokenizer operations:
